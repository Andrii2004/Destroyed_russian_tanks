# Destroyed_russian_tanks

This project aims to use computer vision for automatic detection and assessment of damage to Russian tanks. Using image processing algorithms and Ultralytics' trained YOLO v11 model, the system can analyse images and videos of tanks destroyed or damaged during combat operations, determine the level of damage and provide data for further analysis or decision-making. The project aims to speed up the damage assessment process and help in the operational planning of military operations.
